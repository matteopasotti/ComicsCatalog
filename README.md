## Intro
This application is in Kotlin and consumes Marvel Api to retrieve a list of Characters.
The architecture used is MVVM (Model View ViewModel) with a combination of recent Android Architecture Components released By Google.

If you want to read more about this project and about the components used, i'm writing a series of articles on [Medium](https://medium.com/@matteopasotti)

## How to run the project
The first time you download this repo you will get an error about a file called keys.properties. In order to make it work just check app/build.gralde file
and put your API_KEY

```
buildTypes {
        debug {
            minifyEnabled false
            buildConfigField("String", "MARVEL_API_KEY", "YOUR_API_KEY")
            buildConfigField("String", "MARVEL_PRIVATE_KEY", "YOUR_PRIVATE_API_KEY")
        }

        release {
            minifyEnabled false
            proguardFiles getDefaultProguardFile('proguard-android.txt'), 'proguard-rules.pro'
            buildConfigField("String", "MARVEL_API_KEY",  "YOUR_API_KEY")
            buildConfigField("String", "MARVEL_PRIVATE_KEY",  "YOUR_PRIVATE_API_KEY")
        }
    }
```

## Libraries Used

* [Architecture](https://developer.android.com/jetpack/arch/) - A collection of libraries that help you design robust, testable, and maintainable apps. Start with classes for managing your UI component lifecycle and handling data persistence.
  * [DataBinding](https://developer.android.com/topic/libraries/data-binding/) - - Declaratively bind observable data to UI elements.
  * [LiveData](https://developer.android.com/topic/libraries/architecture/livedata) - Build data objects that notify views when the underlying database changes.
  * [Room](https://developer.android.com/topic/libraries/architecture/room) - Access your app's SQLite database with in-app objects and compile-time checks.
  * [ViewModel](https://developer.android.com/topic/libraries/architecture/viewmodel) - - Store UI-related data that isn't destroyed on app rotations. Easily schedule asynchronous tasks for optimal execution.
  
 ## Upcoming Features
 
 Updates will include incorporating testing parts using Mockito, and new features like the Search of a specific Character
